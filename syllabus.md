## ORAL EXAM (20/12): 15 min

## Reports
* 4 pages long, in french or english
* submitted individually via moodle together with the associated code (the code should produce all the graphs shown in the report)
* can be prepared in groups of 2 students
* penalty for lateness: 20% of marks per week or part week that the work is late

## Deadlines
* 27/09  A working installation of FEniCS (bring your own laptop with a running poisson demo, this will be tested and is a part of the evaluation)
* 24/10  1st report (linear elasticity Eshelby)
* 12/12  2nd report (snapping dynamics of a beam)
